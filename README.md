# WifiDestoryer
A small program running on the wifipineapple, simplifying from the aircrack-ng, by scanning around the Stations and APs and change channel, to send the deauth message, just for fun.

Before you run the program, please use command "airmon-ng start wlan1" to set adapter wlan1 to monitor mode.
